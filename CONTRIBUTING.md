# Contributing Guidelines

We love getting feedback from our users. Bugs and code contributions are great forms of feedback and we thank you for any bugs you report or code you contribute.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new bug, please [check first](https://bugs.mysql.com/search.php) to see if a similar bug already exists.

Bug reports should be as complete as possible. Please try and include the following:

* Complete steps to reproduce the issue.
* Any information about platform and environment that could be specific to the bug.
* Specific version of the product you are using.
* Specific version of the server being used.
* Sample code to help reproduce the issue, if possible.

## Contributing Code

Contributing to MySQL projects is easy. You just need to follow these steps.

* Make sure you have a user account at [bugs.mysql.com](https://bugs.mysql.com). You will need to reference this user account when you submit your Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA).
* Sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement. You can find instructions for doing that at the [OCA Page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html).
* Develop your pull request. Make sure you are aware of the requirements for the project (e.g. do not require Java 7 if we are supporting Java 8 and higher).
* Validate your pull request by including tests that sufficiently cover the functionality you are adding.
* Verify that the entire test suite passes with your code applied.
* Submit your pull request. While you can submit the pull request via [GitHub](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/pulls), you can also submit it directly via [bugs.mysql.com](https://bugs.mysql.com).

Thanks again for your wish to contribute to MySQL. We truly believe in the principles of open source development and appreciate any contributions to our projects.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

You can use your preferred Java IDE to view, edit, and compile the MySQL Connector/J source code. The configuration setup can be adapted from [Installing from Source](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-installing-source.html) with little effort.

Running the entire test suite or your own test case is also possible by setting a few Ant properties in your IDE preferences setup. Refer to [Testing Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-testing.html) for additional details.
