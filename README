AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL

Copyright Amazon.com Inc. or affiliates.



The Amazon Web Services (AWS) JDBC Driver for MySQL is a driver that enables

applications to take full advantage of the features of clustered MySQL databases.

It is based on and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the MySQL Connector/J driver

(https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j) and is compatible with all MySQL deployments.




The AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL currently enables fast failover for Amazon Aurora with MySQL

compatibility. Support for additional features of clustered databases, including features

of Amazon RDS for MySQL and on-premises MySQL deployments, is planned.
