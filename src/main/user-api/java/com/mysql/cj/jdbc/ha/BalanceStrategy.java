     *            the user.

     *            the list of response times for a <strong>transaction</strong>
     *            for each host in the configured hosts list.
     * @param numRetries
     *            the number of times the driver expects this strategy to re-try
     *            connection attempts if creating a new connection fails.
     * @return the physical JDBC connection for the application to use, based
     *         upon the strategy employed.
