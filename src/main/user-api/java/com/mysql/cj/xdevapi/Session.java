/**
 * X DevAPI introduces a new, high-level database connection concept that is called Session. When working with X DevAPI it is important to understand this new
 * Session concept which is different from working with traditional low-level MySQL connections.
 * <p>
 * An application using the Session class can be run against a single MySQL server or large number of MySQL servers forming a sharding cluster with no code
 * changes.
 * <p>
 * When using literal/verbatim SQL the common API patterns are mostly the same compared to using DML and CRUD operations on Tables and Collections. Two
 * differences exist: setting the current schema and escaping names.
 * <p>
 * You cannot call {@link Session#getSchema(String)} or {@link Session#getDefaultSchema()} to obtain a {@link Schema} object against which you can
 * issue verbatin SQL statements. The Schema object does not feature a sql() function.
 * <p>
 * The sql() function is a method of the {@link Session} class. Use {@link Session#sql(String)} and the SQL command USE to change the current
 * schema
 * <p>
 * Session session = SessionFactory.getSession("root:s3kr3t@localhost");<br>
 * session.sql("USE test");
 * <p>
 * If a Session has been established using a data source file the name of the default schema can be obtained to change the current database.
 * <p>
 * Properties p = new Properties();<br>
 * p.setProperty("dataSourceFile", "/home/app_instance50/mysqlxconfig.json");<br>
 * Session session = SessionFactory.getSession(p);<br>
 * String defaultSchema = session.getDefaultSchema().getName();<br>
 * session.sql("USE ?").bind(defaultSchema).execute();<br>
 * <p>
 * A quoting function exists to escape SQL names/identifiers. StringUtils.quoteIdentifier(String, boolean) will escape the identifier given in
 * accordance to the settings of the current connection.
 * The escape function must not be used to escape values. Use the value bind syntax of {@link Session#sql(String)} instead.
 * <p>
 * // use bind syntax for values<br>
 * session.sql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ?").bind(name).execute();<br>
 * <br>
 * // use escape function to quote names/identifier<br>
 * var create = "CREATE TABLE ";<br>
 * create += StringUtils.quoteIdentifier(name, true);<br>
 * create += "(id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT");<br>
 * <br>
 * session.sql(create).execute();
 * <p>
 * Users of the CRUD API do not need to escape identifiers. This is true for working with collections and for working with relational tables.
