AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL

Copyright 2020 Amazon.com Inc. or affiliates.



The AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL is a client driver designed to take full

advantage of the high database availability offered by Aurora MySQL. In

the event of a database failure, this availability is provided via a

process known as failover, which is described below.



The AWS JDBC Driver was created to be a drop-in replacement for the

open-source MySQL-Connector-J JDBC driver (https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j)

and is based off of it. This means that the AWS JDBC Driver can be used

in place to interact with Aurora MySQL, RDS MySQL, and on-premise MySQL,

without experiencing any unexpected or undesired behavior.
