%description
MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in the
Java programming language with @MYSQL_CJ_DISPLAY_PROD_NAME@, a driver that
implements the [Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API]
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/).

@MYSQL_CJ_DISPLAY_PROD_NAME@ @MYSQL_CJ_VERSION_SERIES@ is a JDBC Type 4 driver that is compatible with
the [JDBC 4.2](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/)
specification. The Type 4 designation means that the driver is a pure
Java implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the
MySQL client libraries.

For detailed information please visit the official
[@MYSQL_CJ_DISPLAY_PROD_NAME@ documentation]
(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/).
