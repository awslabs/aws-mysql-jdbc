  * `clusterInstanceHostPattern` failover parameter example ([here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#failover-parameters)).
  * Latest Maven Central URLs for [direct download of the jar file](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#direct-download-of-the-jar-file), [using the driver as a Maven dependency](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#as-a-maven-dependency), and [using the driver as a Gradle dependency](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#as-a-gradle-dependency).

## [1.1.2] - 2022-11-22

* Fixed some incorrect log messages.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-06-29

* Enhanced Failure Monitoring connection status check.

## [0.4.0] - 2021-12-14

### Added
* Ability to execute additional or supplementary logic related to a `Connection` through Connection Plugin Manager. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#connection-plugin-manager). Tutorial on writing custom connection plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc/tree/main/src/demo/java/customplugins).
* [Enhanced Failure Monitoring](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc/#enhanced-failure-monitoring) for improved failure detection.

### Changed
* NetworkFailuresFailoverIntegrationTest now uses environment variables to match FailoverIntegrationTest and ReplicationFailoverIntegrationTest.
* Updated all dependencies.
* Removed `jboss-as-connector` dependency for more up-to-date dependency `javassist`.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-11-18

### Added
* AWS IAM Authentication is now supported. Usage instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#aws-iam-database-authentication).

### Fixed
* Enforce Java 8 in the build process.
* Resolved an issue for when connecting with an invalid connection after a valid connection. Users were able to connect with cached information after a valid connection despite providing invalid information.

### Added
* Upstream changes from MySQL 8.0.23 community driver.

### Changed

## [0.1.0] - 2021-01-06

### Added
* This driver is based on the MySQL 8.0.21 community driver. The driver is cluster aware for Amazon Aurora MySQL. It takes advantage of Amazon Aurora's fast failover capabilities, reducing failover times from minutes to seconds.
